## I. Let's break down the events that the ticket-processing system must respond to, including the type of event, resulting use case, and the relevant actors. Given that the existing system uses paper forms and a state patrol clerk enters the information, we'll define our actors accordingly.

# Key Actors
- Officer: Issues tickets and may request information regarding tickets.
- State Patrol Clerk: Responsible for entering ticket details into the system and updating ticket information.
- System: The ticket-processing system that manages the data and processes requests.
- Payment Processing System: Handles the financial transactions related to the tickets.



# Potential Changes in a New System
In a new system, there are opportunities for efficiency and accuracy that might change the actors involved:

- Automated Data Entry: If the new system allows officers to enter ticket information directly via a mobile app or a tablet, the Officer could replace the State Patrol Clerk for the initial data entry.
- Integrated Payment System: If there's an integrated payment system, the Officer might directly handle payments or notifications related to the ticket, reducing the clerical load.
- Centralized Database Access: Officers could have direct access to ticket statuses and history, streamlining communication and reducing reliance on the State Patrol Clerk.





## II. Here are brief use case descriptions for each of the identified use cases in the ticket-processing system:

# Use Case Descriptions
1. Capture Ticket Information

Description: When an officer issues a ticket, they will fill out all relevant information regarding the violation, including the driver's details, vehicle information, and the nature of the offense. This ticket is then handed over to the state patrol clerk for data entry into the system.

2. Enter Ticket Details into System

Description: Upon receiving the paper ticket from the officer, the state patrol clerk opens the ticket-processing system and enters the details into the database. The clerk ensures that all fields are accurately filled out, including ticket number, officer ID, date, and violation specifics.

3. Validate Ticket Information

Description: Once the ticket details are entered, the system performs validation checks to ensure that all required fields are completed and that the provided data adheres to predefined formats. If errors are detected, the clerk is notified to correct them before the ticket is finalized in the system.

4. Retrieve Ticket Information

Description: When an officer needs to check the status of a ticket they issued, they can query the system using the ticket number or other identifiers. The system retrieves and displays the ticket details, including its status, any payments made, and any additional notes.

5. Modify Ticket Details

Description: If there is a need to update ticket information (e.g., correcting an officer's error or adding notes), the state patrol clerk accesses the existing ticket record within the system. They make the necessary changes and save the updated information, ensuring that the ticket record reflects the most current data.

6. View Ticket History

Description: Officers can access the ticket-processing system to review the history of tickets issued over a specified time period. The system displays relevant details such as dates, violations, and statuses, enabling officers to track their performance and follow up on outstanding tickets.

7. Process Payment

Description: When an officer or the ticket recipient decides to resolve a ticket by making a payment, the system facilitates this transaction. The officer or clerk inputs payment details, and the payment processing system handles the transaction. Upon successful payment, the system updates the ticket status accordingly.

8. Update Ticket Status

Description: After a ticket has been resolved or closed, the state patrol clerk updates the ticket status in the system. This may involve marking the ticket as "paid," "dismissed," or "in court." The system then reflects this updated status for future reference and reporting.
